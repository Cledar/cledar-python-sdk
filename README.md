# Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Install `pre-commit` by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2. Once `pre-commit` is installed, set up the pre-commit hooks by running:
    ```
    pre-commit install
    ```

That's it! You are now ready to start working with the project.
